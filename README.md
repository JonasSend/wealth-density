# Wealth (and population) density maps 
Plots the density of population and wealth (as population density multiplied by country-specific wealth per capita as a simple proxy) across the globe. Currently set to night view.

Rendering of the wealth density map takes a few hours in the current implementation.

Also creates a GIF that loops back and forth between the two maps.
