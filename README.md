## Wealth (and population) density maps 
Plots the density of population and wealth (as population density multiplied by country-specific wealth per capita as a simple proxy\*) across the globe. Currently set to night view.

Rendering of the wealth density map takes a few hours in the current implementation.

Also creates a GIF that loops back and forth between the two maps.

\* Since data on wealth per capita is restricted to adults, this overestimates the relative wealth density of "young" (and thus usually poor) countries
